# SAS project : Recessions prediction

### Project goal
In 1995, Arturo Estrella and Frederic S. Mishkin highlighted a link between the inversion of the yield curve and a future economic recession within 6 to 18 months. Their work was subsequently replicated
with very convincing results. This project aims to replicate the studies of Mishkin and Estrella and to validate their study across multiple countries over the period from 1990 to 2024 using OECD data.

### Project steps
- Data frame building
- Data analysis
- Logistic regressions (with LASSO penalty)
